    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio Landing Page!</h1>
    <p>It is a documentation of my journey as a beginner in software development at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>.</p>
    <p>Walk this journey with me.</p>
    <p>I had a little help from Moringa School in this project</p>
    <p>In the subsequent sections of this page, I will use <strong>My progress</strong></p>
    <h1>My progress</h1>
    <p><strong>My progress</strong>My progress was slow and steady because I was also improving other parts of my life that have helped me become a better person and ultimately a better developer. Now I am a Software Engineer working on a product that is helping people’s lives and I get to work with an amazing team. To wake up everyday knowing that I get to do what I love was worth the long journey.

The resources that I am going to cover helped me move forward towards reaching my goal while having a full time job with crazy on call hours, a relationship, family, friends, volunteering, and a few setbacks along the way. I really hope this post will bring value to you on your journey! <em>My progress</em> My parents immigrated to the United States when they were teenagers and since then have been field workers. We weren’t sure why college was important, but we knew it was so I applied to universities with little knowledge of what I should be prepared for..</p>
    <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
    <p>I first discovered programming while attending my undergraduate program. It took me two years of exploring engineering courses to declare my major in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). Our CSE program was very theoretical and introduced us to algorithms, computer designs/systems, and theories. However, having no prior experience with code, I felt lost and didn’t understand the value of these concepts. It felt as though the program was geared towards people who already knew how to code.

We completed projects, but I didn’t fully apply the new knowledge towards solving real world problems or building practical skills. As the projects became more challenging, I didn’t have the courage to ask for help when I was stuck. It seemed like most of my classmates knew what they were doing and had it figured out, so I was embarrassed to reach out.

One key thing I wasn’t aware about was the importance of internships. Instead, I would go back home during school breaks and work in the fields with my mom to help pay for college expenses. Nonetheless, I pushed through and received my CSE degree.</p>
    <h2>Studies?</h2>
    <p> n 2015, I was feeling really lost and without a sense of purpose in my career. I wanted to align my mission of improving and empowering people’s lives with my career path. I also wanted to be a direct influence and a decision maker of the product I was supporting. In the role and company I was working for as a Technical Support Engineer, I didn’t see that being possible. I wasn’t getting enough project opportunities that could strengthen my software development skills.

One day it finally hit me. I wanted to build applications that improve and motivate lives. How could I accomplish this? I had the answer all along. I wanted to become the software developer I had originally set my intention to while in college and this time I wasn’t going to give up.

The 2 years of having worked as a Technical Support Engineer wasn’t enough to get me interviews for Software Engineer roles. Every company wanted at least a year of professional experience in building software. From then, I started researching where I could find the experience or education I needed to become a software developer. I could go back to school and get my master’s, but now days a degree in Computer Science isn’t necessary to land a developer job. People recommended to start building projects on the side. Ok awesome! But what was I supposed to program and in what language? Was I supposed to come up with a new big idea? Fortunately I found freeCodeCamp.</p>
    <h2>Free Code freeCodeCamp</h2>
    <p>freeCodeCamp is a free self paced curriculum where you learn web development and gain skills by building projects on your free time. What got me most excited about this curriculum was that it helped me focus my time on building instead of worrying about what to build. Also if you get far along the program, you get to build projects for nonprofits!I didn’t complete the curriculum, but got far enough to build many front-end and back-end projects that boosted my portfolio. Being part of freeCodeCamp was also a gateway to joining an amazing community that helped me find other external resources that have led me to land my first software engineer role.</p>
    <h3>Meet-Ups in Free Code freeCodeCamp</h3>
    <p>Attending meetups always put me out of my comfort zone because I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to make conversations. But once I was there, I learned so much, shared tips and resources, and usually left inspired! Even after having attended so many meetups, I still get nervous before attending one.</p>
    <h3>Community Service</h3>
    <p>"It can get pretty lonely when learning to code so having people that understand what you’re going through and support you really helps. I couldn’t always make it out to meetups so having an online community was very convenient.

I decided to use Twitter as my main way of interacting with other developers and aspiring developers. I have been able to share learning resources, my struggles, accomplishments, and anything else that might benefit others in my field. Since I follow developers, my twitter feed mainly consists of tech news, articles, resources, and any other technical goodies.

Through my twitter community, I was able to receive the feedback needed to help convince myself that I had what it took to be a developer. I was able to get the mentorship to help me when I was stuck or felt lost in my coding journey. People in this field really want to help!"</p>
  <p>"I started listening to engineering podcasts on my commute to work and I can tell you this is the best tip I have followed. You get to learn from developers that have been in this industry for years who are excited to teach and share their ideas and experiences.

Some people have said that engineering podcasts are dry, but not the ones I’ve been listening to! These developers are funny, caring, smart, and excited.

I was asked many times during my interviews whether I listened to podcasts. This was a great way to show how proactive and passionate I was about this field.</p>
<p>Attending my first hackathon helped me experience what being a developer was all about in a short amount of time and boosted my confidence. The following were a few things that I got to experience for my first time at the event, including collaborating</p>
